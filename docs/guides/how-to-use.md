# How to use Item Market

## Intro
Blockchain technology might sound scary, but we made a solution that allows hassle-free daily interactions with the tech while keeping all the features like decentralized ownership and safe trade.


## Prerequisites 

Waves Keeper. The only thing you need to start interacting with tokenized items is a free browser extension [Waves Keeper](https://wavesplatform.com/products-keeper). Waves Keeper signs transactions on your behalf, you can consider it a a bank app where you confirm transfers. Yes, our tech is even safer then your bank.

Account. If you don’t have an account with Waves yet - the best way is to create one directly in Keeper, just launch the addon right after the installation.

::: tip
Please make sure to write down your seed phrase – this is the only way to access your items the next time you want them. Keep it secure as seed phrase is both a login and a password to your account!

## Buying an item
First things first - your game has to be integrated with Item Market. This doesn't take much and if your game is not here yet - just reach out to the developer (e.g. game forum always works!).

How do I top up my account balance?

The buying flow is quite natural and the only thing that might raise a question is account top up. 

::: tip
Item Market uses Waves cryptocurrency as main payment method, both for items and transaction commission. Each transaction would cost 0,003 Waves or $0,004 (check!)
:::

 - If you don't have Waves yet you would need to top up your account using the method available on Item Market. This is also a straightforward process, but since cryptocurrencies are strictly regulated you'd need to go through a "KYC" procedure or identity verification process. This means that the payment provider might request additional documents and would need to approve you before you can make any payments.

 - If you already have cryptocurrencies you can purchase Waves using [Waves Decentralized Exchange](https://dex.wavesplatform.com/) (DEX).

Need to display as TIP (!) If the item you'd like to buy is not yet for sale you can always make a bet and indicate the demand to item owner. When making a bet Item Market would only charge  the transaction fee, the bet itself would only be charged in case of successful transaction.  

## Selling an item

In order to sell an item please navigate to inventory section under your account. Find the item you'd like to sell, chose the price & how long you'd like this offer to be active. Please note that the system would require a small fee in Waves to place your item.
